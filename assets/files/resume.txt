Education
B.A. in computer science at University oF CaliFornia, Berkeley
Graduation: Fall 2016

Projects
Graph API - trip Finder (Java)
Wrote a graph api used to create a trip finder using vertices as locations and edges as 
roads. i Worked With variations of depth-first search and breadth-first search imple-
mentations as Well as Dijkstra’s algorithm and a* (a-star). 

File Compressor (Java)
made a program that compresses files and directories using huffman encoding algorithms.

CPU, assembler and linker (logism, mips, C)
Worked on different proJects With the goal to simulate a computer using a risc-v processor and
build each part of the process to interpret binary instructions.

Neural network optimization (C)
Worked on optimizing an existing neural netWork by using cache blocking techniQues, and 
extensions such as sse intrinsics and intel avx.

Skills: Python, Javascript, html, css, C, postrgreSQL, Java, MIPS, spark, OpenMP, SSE.

I work as a ta for cs10 (the beauty and Joy of computing) at Berkeley. my duties 
involve leading lab sections as Well as Weekly discussion. cs10 is a class designed 
for non-majors to explore computer science. We teach students using a programming 
language called snap! (similar to mit’s scratch). it is exciting to be part of a team that 
shapes a class currently taken by thousands of people through edX.
